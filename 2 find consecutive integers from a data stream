Intuition
If question ask to check the last k parsed integers are equal to value or not. Then why not to only count last K integers if they are equal to value.

Approach
Take a counter & only increment if num is equal to value.
if counter at any moment becomes equal to K, that means its satisifying the condition, thus returns true else false.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(1)

Code
class DataStream {
    private int val = 0;
    private int pastK = 0, k = 0;

    public DataStream(int value, int k) {
        this.val = value;
        this.pastK = 0;
        this.k = k;
    }
    
    public boolean consec(int num) {
        if(num == val) {
            pastK++;
        } else {
            pastK = 0;
        }
        // there can be exactly K or more than k numbers = val
        return k <= pastK;
    }
}
